v0.3.2a Fixed broken stuff
	- Hey guys sorry I left everything broken for like... a year
	- School's rough, but after deleting 6 hours of coding I'm a bit
	- tired of this so I took a break. This should work as intended

v0.3.2 User-oriented!
	- Made a server install script
	- Made threads able to be changed with a single variable before compiling
	- Added delay to the client so it doesn't eat up all the CPU
	- Supports between 1 to 2147483647 cores
	- If you have 2147483647, why are you running this program?
	- Updated README

v0.3.1 Prepping for release!
	- Polished up the code
	- Added better programs
	- Added a prompt to the client
	- Made a proper README.txt file with instructions

v0.3.0 Client/Server!
	- Simple client/server model
	- Records tempatures
	- Single user, single server
	- Just FTP commands

v0.2.0 Multi-Threading!
	- Initially supports 4 threads
	- This was a lot of fun to make and the first multi-threaded program I've ever made!
	- Has some flaws:
		- if one thread is downloading, the other 3 threads have to wait until it's done

v0.1.0 Lighting McQueen!
	- Interrupts youtube-dl call if date not found
	- So much faster my goodness
	- 56 channels with 2 downloads in 40 minutes
	- Though when I tested it it was one channel every 8 seconds

v0.0.2 Logs to file!
	- Logs time and command to a text file
	- Took too long to code because I have no brain power
	- Super small update, don't worry about it


V0.0.1 Initial version that works!
	- Reads from .txt file a list of channels to download
	- Downloads them with youtube-dl
	- Doesn't stop after noticing there are no new videos to download (just runs the youtube-dl command)
	- Runs on minimal RAM Raspbian, Neofetch and program run at max 75MB RAM
	- Fairly CPU intensive, uses 17-25% of Raspberry Pi's CPU
